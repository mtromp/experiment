# Frequency Mathematics

I am interested in deepening my knowledge of mathematics, especially the math
used in working with frequencies. I am also interested in displaying waveforms
on the screen in a way that emulates a multi-channel oscilloscope. I want to
develop a library that can be used in applications for showing how the frequencies
are manipulated.
