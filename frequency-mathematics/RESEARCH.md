Here is a list of some interesting github repositories. Search "oscilloscope library"

- [Vector Synthesis](https://github.com/macumbista/vectorsynthesis) This is for
  driving certain devices with vector inputs to separate channels.
- [Scope Hardware Abstraction Layer](https://github.com/azonenberg/scopehal) This
  is written in C++. No README.md to help understand what it is for.
- [Scope HAL Applications](https://github.com/azonenberg/scopehal-apps) Applications
  that use Scope Hardware Abstraction Layer.
- [Processing Library](https://github.com/ffd8/xyscope) This converts graphics to

  to assist in generating oscilloscope drawings.


- [PC-based Oscilloscope](http://www.geekyedge.com/turn-your-old-pc-into-a-cheap-oscilloscope/) Perhaps I need to search for different keywords.
- [Laptop-based Oscilloscope](https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Your-Laptop-as-Oscilloscope/) This one has a link to ZELSCOPE.
- [ZELSCOPE](http://www.zelscope.com) A Windows application. FAQ indicates that
  there are applications for Linux or Mac by searching for xoscope or Amadeus.
- [Chrome-based Scope](https://academo.org/demos/virtual-oscilloscope/) This is
  for online use.
- [xoscope](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xoscope/) Meant for data coming from
  a sound card. For BSD or Linux. Last updated in 2016.
- [qtoscilloscope](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtoscilloscope/) Meant for
  displaying data from AnalogDiscovery on a pc using a oscilloscope type display.
  Last updated in 2015. ***This looks like a promising starting point.***
- [Search SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/directory/science-engineering/visualization/os:mac/?q=oscilloscope) Here's how I did a search in SourceForge.
